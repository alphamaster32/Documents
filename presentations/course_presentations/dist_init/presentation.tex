    \frametitle{Introduction}
    With the technology going forward we are seeing more embedded devices.
    These embedded devices found their way into our most classical
    inventions like cars. Smart cars need secure and fast networks that will
    enable different parts within and or outside of the car to communicate
    efficiently.

    \frametitle{Emphasis}
    To have a greater grasp of this idea we need to have not only
    but included knowledge of the items below
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Security.
        \item Performance.
        \item Types of networks like CAN ,Ethernet, and \textit{etc}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Project Incentive}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The need to merge high and low bandwidth networks together in a
            distributed way.
        \item Computations may need to be done in the Edge nodes.
    \end{itemize}
